# Academic Performance Trends - Data Analysis
---
## Project Description

As a part of my **Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill Path** from Codecademy, I have created this project to put together and improve on the skills I have learned through analyzing data from the "Forbes 2000 Global Companies" dataset I have collected from Kaggle.

Currently I am using the programming language Python and will be using various libraries to further expand on my analysis (E.g. Pandas, matplotlib.py, and NumPy)

## Project Goals ü•Ö

My main aim in this project is to put together all of the skills I have learnt from the Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill path and hopefully build upon/improve those skills. This project will allow me to help solidify my knowledge in areas such as "Exploratory Data Analysis".


#### Questions I plan to answer:

  1. Does studying for longer periods of time produce better results on the exam?
  2. Does attending class actually have an impact on your exam results or can you get away with simply independent studying? 
  3. If you had a bad score on the previous exam are you more likely to try harder by studying lots or give up by studying less?
  4. If you had a good score on the previous exame are you more likely to be motivated and study more or be a bit more lenient?
  5. Do previous exam results impact how you achieve on the next exam?
  6. Did students who on average slept longer achieve better? Was sleeping too much or too little harmful?
